## Bills Introduced in the 2025 Texas Legislative Session

### November 12 to January 17

This is the analysis portion of bill data since the start of the filing period up until Jan. 17. I'm importing the data file I saved from the cleaning portion. These are some of the questions I hope to answer:

-   x

-   y

-   z

### Setup

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
library(lubridate)
```

### Importing my clean data

```{r}
read_rds("data-processed/01-texasbills.rds")
```
