## Bills Introduced in the 2025 Texas Legislative Session

### January 18 to February 2

This is the analysis portion of bill data since the start of the filing period up until Feb. 2. I'm importing the data file I saved from the cleaning portion. These are some of the questions I hope to answer:

-   Which lawmakers are filing the most? And how does that relate to party?

-   Where are the bills coming from across the State?

-   

How to filter for keyword: filter(grepl("word", column, ignore.case = TRUE))

### Setup

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(janitor)
```

### Importing my clean data

```{r}
read_rds("data-processed/02texasbills.rds")
```
